Instruments are and open holed concert Gemeinhardt Student Flute (purchased used) and Harpsicle® Sharpsicle as performed/sampled by Shawn Eary. Because Shawn Eary is a beginning flautist and harpist, he had to rely on sampling to correct beginner mistakes.

All content in this project was generated by Shawn Eary using Cubase 13, KDENLive and a GoPro so it is assumed to be free game as long as you give CC BY-SA attribution. As far as I know, you shouldn't have to worry about third-party royalties (or complaints). I believe I have the legal right to sample the instruments I have purchased fair and square provided I am the one that plays them.
